# VetCare â€“ Veterinary Clinic Management System

![App Logo](src/main/resources/static/assets/images/vetcare.png)


---

**VetCare** is a full-stack application developed using **Spring Boot** and **MySQL**, designed to assist veterinary clinics in managing appointments, pet medical records, and prescriptions. The system includes distinct user roles **pet owners** and **clinic admins** to support seamless and secure access to essential clinic services.
> Still working on improving the UI for the rest of the features...
> Initially developed as part of an academic assignment, I was part of backend team. The frontend was completely redesigned by me afterward for improved user experience and functionality.
